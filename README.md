# Amazon Vine Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
In this project, we will do an analyizing on 50 datasets. Each one contains reviews of a specific product. We picked Gift Cards datasets. We used PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. And then used PySpark again to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in our dataset.
